### HTTP_C
#### A Minimalist HTTP Server Built from Scratch in C

This project is designed to provide a deeper understanding of how an HTTP server operates, while also serving as an opportunity to learn and practice the C programming language. By building the server from the ground up, without relying on external libraries or abstractions, it offers a clear and direct insight into the inner workings of HTTP communication and low-level server design.
